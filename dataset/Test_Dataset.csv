15,i read an article a while back that was from an interview with a ypg commander in the siege/battle of kobani where he was saying that isis would do everything humanly possible to take capture the ypj fighters alive. isis would then torture and r@pe them to death while broadcasting it over ypg radios as a psychological warfare type thing. the commander then talked about a body exchange they did with isis where they gave back 3 dead isis fighters and were supposed to get 4 or 5 dead ypj fighters and when they did the swap isis brought in 3 bags full of body parts because they had butchered the female fighters while they were still alive. he said from that moment on he kept an extra grenade to use on himself if it came down to it.,0

595,"lol at the last 30 seconds. that's the quintessential point brought up by people who have done psychedelics. im glad you were able to look at that in a joking manner.. even though i do agree with everything you said. to people who haven't tripped, the answer is simple.. of course the wall is real. but for those of us who have tripped, those can be some tough questions to ask. they don't sneak their way into your head until you've had an experience where the constructs of reality dissolve, then you see just how malleable our perception, and the subsequent manifested reality, can be.   for me, the only problem with tripping so much back in the day was that by dissolving the constructs of the world around me, i kind of lost my footing so to speak. i believe that our understanding of this world as a solid, defined object is integral to our life experience. viewing the world from this perspective helps you to understand the weight of things, the physical consequences of actions. that every thought we have will manifest some physical outcome.  when we lose that grip on the solidity of the world around us, we in essence lose our grounding, for how can you stand upon a crumbling rock? like aldous huxley, and many others who tripped, i struggle with reconciling my metaphysical experiences with my normal physical one. i do believe this has something to do with the opening of the heart, or the lack of opening i guess. in some old books it's called kundalini syndrome, it has other names in other texts, but the idea is that you don't awaken the third eye/pineal gland until the heart has been properly opened, or else you can get a whole host of negative problems. i suppose i didn't understand the weight of this before. i believe now that the struggle i've had since tripping is due to the fact that my heart had not opened before tripping , if it was i think it might have facilitated and allowed the true merging of my physical self with my spiritual self. see we can reach crazy heights spiritually without the need to prepare, but our ego will return and come back to bite us. no matter what, the psychedelic experience will dissolve the ego, i think the goal though is to see the flaws of our ego, and work against them in our normal everyday experience. you overtime learn to live with your mind aligned with your heart. as this happens, the negative aspects of the ego atrophy, and the positive ones are amplified. i am excited for my next time to trip, i want this trip to be a confirmation of the path im on, rather than a wake up call to drop a whole bunch of bad habits. sure those trips are useful, but when you return to sobriety, your body is still entrenched in the karmic cycles of your normal self, so it is easy for that same selfish ego to be built up again off of a body that is still selfish. the best example i can give is this: say you've been masturbating, and you don't want to anymore, so you trip, ""see the light"" and stop. sure, this is possible, but 9/10 times, the person returns to said negative habit very shortly after the trip. this is because there are still rogue nerve impulses and the associated  pavlovian responses stuck within the body. the body and brain are like a huge mycelial network, every part learning from every other part. (look up proprioception, it has to do with nerve cells ability to sense their spatial relationship to other cells.)so if you haven't cleaned your body before you plan to clean your mind, you will not be able to maintain said mental cleanliness because the reverberations of past thoughts and actions that are imprinted into your physical body will relay their information back to the brain and rebuild that same pesky ego. so instead, let's say you work against the very physical impulse to masturbate every day until that impulse is virtually gone. then, when you trip, you will be able to look back in confidence, and even though your ego will still dissolve, you can rest assured that it will be built upon a stronger foundation when it returns. some people trip bc they feel no way out of those negative cylces. i've felt the same way.. but that is the point of opening the heart. it's always easier to remain closed off, especially when changing looks so difficult. but when we finally give in, we see the only struggle was our inability to give in and live by our hearts in the first place. in essence, choosing literally to live in your heart will take your mind away from your cock(or whatever vice you have) long enough to clear out those unhealthy neural pathways. same goes for smoking cigarettes, beating your wife, lying, and any other undesirable habit. the only way to ensure lasting change after a trip is to open up the heart beforehand.. because an open heart guides the reestablishment of an ego that has your spirit and body's best intentions in mind, instead of the usual (physical)self serving ego that exists.  in simple terms, when we literally physically open our hearts, we allow our physical urges to be illuminated by that spiritual light from above.    in the words of thoth, ""this, my children, is your purpose in being: transmutation of darkness into light!""   in the words of maynard keenan, ""turn these leaden grudges into gold""    in the words of me, ""instead of ignoring the shit in your life, illuminate it, that it may become the fertilizer from which a new understanding can grow and blossom.""    beyond the froo froo talk of opening one's heart, i believe there is a very real reason why opening our hearts physically is so prudent. it is our electromagnetic center, the middle of the toroidal field surrounding each one of us. when you trip, it is common knowledge that the third eye is opened. some say it's the pituitary, some say it's the pineal. from what i can gather from the baghavad gita, the pituitary gland is the third eye, and it is activated by it's union with the pineal gland. this happens with high doses of psychedelics, and will no matter what facilitate at least some sort of spiritual expereince. but to have one that truly cleanses our entire being,for good,  the heart must be opened. when the physical heart center is activated, the positive energy from the heavens above and the negative (negative meaning negated, not bad) energy from the world below are able to flow together like yin and yang, as they were meant to, instead of fighting one another constantly for total control",0

After that time, i understood what happened, the episode with my stepfather clarified for me and i was able to forgive him to move on. i felt a lightness. i was still afraid to go back. i even dreamed that i was doing the ayahuasca ritual. so i returned once more. this time i visualized only good things. i think i traveled all over the world. i saw the smile of my children and how grateful i am for the family i formed. despite everything, I'm too afraid to do it again. last time, as good as it was, time didn't pass, i was stuck in an infinite loop. i want to return, but I'm also afraid because I'm a very controlling person and in the ritual your mind unfolds very freely.",0

1680,"i understand your idealistic anti-drug vision of portraying adderall as being almost useless, but the truth is different.  you don't need scientific proof to demonstrate if it's useful, the pro players using it for more than !10 years! prove it is. because pro players understand adderall does not improve by 10% or 25%, but by a small amount, a 1% in performance. and that bonus to attention is enough at the highest level of play. the goal is entering the flow state, being completely focused on the game, surrounding, sound etc  an important factor about pro players is (at least the responsible ones) only take aderall for the matches that they need it. meaning that in scrims, practice or ranked games, they will usually not take aderall.   and that implies that usually pro players are very aware of the difference between what it's like to play clean and what it's like to play on aderall.  ps: i am not advocating for taking aderall because for the average non-pro player, the +1% is definitely not worth it to take a prescription drug with negative side effects.",0

1736,"the warmth you experienced can come from meditation, which naturally creates a blissful state no drug can emulate.  the mushrooms caused the nausea and exhaustion.  the fear and fraction were caused by your subconscious mind trying to communicate to your conscious mind that the drugs are enslaving you.  you asked your sub-mind how to quit drugs and your mind answered; not the shrooms.  your deep mind,  which is most accessible during drug-free meditative states, was trying to tell you that using the drugs is an act of self-annihilation (which is why it causes people to kill themselves) and your mind also told you that the drugs are attracting people who are not good for you to interact with because they reinforce your unhealthy behavior.  the shrooms made this realization scary and unclear because it was mixed in with your body's feedback from a state of dis-ease as it was trying to detoxify the drug for seven hours.  your sub-mind showed you pictures of scary things as a way to warn you about self-abuse.  demonic imagery is a universal warning sign to stay away... it symbolizes a destructive force of evil influence and therefore elicits fear. fear is said to be the opposite of love and in this sense it is to be avoided... not overcome. to say you must overcome  this fear is to say that you must accept it and in doing so, to accept the absence of self-love and care. this is not true. the sub-mind is intuitive and instinctually, lovingly preserves the mind, body and soul. you deserve love.  there is no doubt about it.  as you said, the drug lied. it's trying to tell you it's good but it's not.  the proof is in the fear and discomfort it creates.  the good thing is that you're becoming aware of the bliss that meditation can bring. this perhaps is the path to peace and love.  experiment with meditation, not drugs and you will meet your true and precious self. 💕🎀💕 i meditated with you during the video with the intention to match your intention to get off the drugs and this is what came up in my mind. thank you. many blessings to you and your viewers. 🙏",0

3940,"ngl i've experienced that ""thoughts coming out of someone else's mouth"" with close friends even while sober. when you're that in sync with someone it just happens naturally. perhaps psychedelics just allow people to get in sync like that; so incredibly attuned to each other, which is why it's almost as though you're speaking telepathically. some people have actually ""spoken"" to each other with a sober trip sitter seeing that neither of them spoke aloud.. so we honestly don't know. science hasn't been able to explain that, not yet at least. there's a lot we still don't know despite the progress we've made",0

3993,"  you say that: nothing cant create something, there has to be something before. you also say that god was the first thing to exist, then does that not mean that god came from nothing? and if god can come from nothing, couldnt a big bang also come from nothing? you also say that an explosion can only destroy, that isnt entirely true. an explosion is displacement of matter at a high velocity, sometimes that destroys the area around the explosion, but not always. the big bang was all matter that ever has, and will exist, being displaced at high speed from the singular point that it originated from. you also say that order cannot come from caos, to argue that point, i would like to point to the paper slit experiment.

4396,"  because they are more stable conjugate bases. think of it this way. hcl is a strong acid, meaning it completely dissociates 100% if if completely dissociates, then it wants to be h+ and cl - more than it wants to be hcl. the reason is because the elements cl and br are in the 3rd and 4th period on the periodic table (respectively) meaning the have 3p and 4p atomic orbitals which hold the valence electrons (outtermost), since these orbitals have a more distant radius from the nucleus, the are stabilized over a larger area. remember, electrons want to repel each other, and if they have more room in order to spread out, then they are at less reactive and at a lower energy level (everything wants to get to the lowest energy level). so even though in the case of hf acid,  the flourine is more electronegative it is a smaller atom and the electrons are held only in the 2p orbital and are repelling each other because that orbital is closer to the nucleus.  just think of this the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base.",0

4601,"Hi, I've been on about 350 trips, not on LSD, on nbome, which is relatively more prone to bad trips, specifically psychedelic drugs, few know, they are substances used since the beginning of humanity to self-initiate the profane or neophyte into the ""occult"", This form of self-initiation is carried out from a depersonalization, a mentalist experience and if the initiate points to the follower, he can do the labors of Hercules to reach the great work or divinity. The point is that psychedelics first, as the word indicates, expel the unconscious through ""hallucination/visual"" psyche. which is generally where mental traumas that forge what we know as ""ego"" are kept, but drugs are more dangerous than that since the brain handles electricity and the flow of this through the neural network generates magnetism, if used Well, the psychomagnetic phenomenon is obtained, which when misused can generate serious consequences, apart from the fact that to reach that state, the amount of ""energy"" supported by the brain is enormous and can literally fry the brain. Not everything is pretty in psychedelics and it is always good to prevent that curing in a certain way is what the law does by outlawing them. greetings brother!",0

4996,the tree of the knowledge and the tree of life ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  it has been understood that there were two trees in the garden of eden(இடம்) to the religionists but only the tantrist see it as one and the same.  the serpent is the symbol of virility of sexual energy and it was the best in creation( it is not satan as the religionists wants you to believe) the tree is the symbol of the human body and the fruit of it was to keep the body eternal.  sex which is tantric oneness was done outside the sphere of god because god himself was outside of creation after the act of creating and the inner formation was not yet there therefore the forbidding to eat which will cause death. creation on its own without god will bring an annihilation which is its true nature.  eve/hawwah( ஆயா) initiated the cycle of death to which she obtained her menses the manifestation of going out of life( a woman if she does not bear a child will have her monthly discharge of blood) the formation of children was suppose to be the remedy for going out on the way of the anti-god(ego).  the tree of life guarded by the cherub with the flaming sword shows how we must go through the painful fire of inferno of total suffering before we could come back to ourselves to be the tree of life again with the holy complete sexual union  even beyond the marriage contract. here the male and female has come together under the will of heaven and what god has put together.  mary magdalene is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the virgin mother is the tree of life and both of them are one and the same person in tantra . the sinner and saint are one in the salvation of eternal life where death is forever within the tree and that sustains life by its food!,0

5191,"when i lived in an ashram, i was asked to pick up an ancient shiva statue from another ashram. it was a twelve hour drive in an old hippie van with bald tires.  we got there an hour before evening meditation.  i found a chair where i could take a nap.  i dreamed that we were driving the van with bald tires in a snowstorm on the interstate with the statue in the rear.  when i woke up, we meditated, ate and went to sleep.  the next morning as we were driving back with the statue, i told my companion about the dream and we agreed to be careful but it was early september, so not too worried.  oh, i forgot.  in the dream we ended up in a ditch in the middle of the interstate with a cop car's flashing lights in front of us.  well, we got into the mountains and it started snowing.  wow.  we slowed way down but with the slick road and the bald tires we soon ended up in the ditch.  now sliding into the ditch was scary and we both forgot about the dream.  we were trying to drive out of the ditch but it was too slippery.  we kept trying and ended up driving a mile in the ditch.  then we stopped to think about a different approach when i looked out the windshield and saw the cop car with flashing lights another half mile ahead.  he was parked on a small earthen bridge over the ditch that connected east and west sides of the freeway.  just like in the ""dream"" the night before.  we drove down to the earthen bridge and got back on to the road and went home. btw, i'm a retired civil engineer who spent 40 years designing sewage treatment plants.",0

(it feels wrong and awkward).  i have this scary dreams like falling and smashing your face on the floor and got stabbed or even painful torture that can ruin my dream.(yes i like horror games, movies etc. and yes i enjoy my dream weird to say this but i would rather get nightmares than to get that in that paralysed condition). thats my story and experience with lucid dream). i would love to hear if there is other who is the same as me. cuz who knew. i remember this beautiful woman on my dream but all i have is her voice and thats it. cant even recognise her face.",0
5359,"and it's not about hate either...  this is the man people are worshipping ""cesare borgia"" and once again a man not god. rabbi jacobson even quoted from the torah god says no man shall see me and live. nothing of this false messiah has done has brought about the requirements of what the true messiah is to accomplish.   zechariah 8:23  so said the lord of hosts: in those days, when ten men of all the languages of the nations shall take hold of the skirt of a jewish man, saying, let us go with you, for we have heard that god is with you.  speaking of prophecy of endtimes.  and even if this jesus character was supposedly resurrected, so what? eliyahu was also resurrected.  the hebrew word בְּרִית (bris) in jeremiah 31:31 does not mean a bible or refer to a new salvation program or torah. the word bris always refers to a covenant, promise, or a contract. this covenant was made with the jewish people while they were still in the wilderness  long before they entered the promised land.   brit ברית in general does not mean a new torah the word for torah in hebrew is תורה.  oh the trinity... let's see how far this pagan idea originates.. egyptian (osiris, isis, horus) hindu (vishnu, sheva, brahma) greek (zues, hades, posiden) norse (odin, vili, and ve)  it is a pagan idea.  and isaiah 53 the suffering servant is israel. i mean there's so many things i could go over, but just goto rabbi tovia singer and he explains things in a great detail using only scripture that shows how everything about the jesus character is a big contradiction.",0

5659,"mdma is a great drug when used correctly. it is not  a drug to be abused. you have to respect it more than you respect yourself. i've actually been through a long-term comedown from going over the top. i had only used it about 3 or 4 times over in a period of 3 years, never taking more than 0.2g in a night. however, on the most recent occasion i took 1g over 2 nights. the worst thing you could possibly do. my serotonin levels would've been completely depleted. 1g is a dangerous dose, you should never do more than 0.2-0.4g in a night. i was severely depressed for a month afterwards, and would regularly have brain zaps throughout the day(this is truly fucking horrible. it's like a literal shock to your brain which jolts you and makes you dizzy for a few seconds). i've since recovered, but i had genuinely thought i destroyed my life due to those 2 nights. do not let 1 mistake ruin you. i've heard of people having permanent effects from overdosing and abusing mdma by taking regularly.",0

6038,"  nice try, but you have totally ignored what icelands current militant position (that i have laid out) is. when britain invaded iceland, they not only had no army to fight a battle away from home, but did not yet even have a real home defence system. i am referring to icelands defences today. which are not only adequate, but entirely constructed for the sole purpose of home defence. but more to the point, it was a reference to show that you were wrong about what scotlands involvement in nato would entail. it was an example of a far less militantly mobile country still having affairs in nato that you were trying to claim scotland would not achieve. and i'm not accusing you of doing so (i'm just trying to read between the lines here), but i hope you are not also making the assumption that scotland wouldn't have adequate home defence and also be invaded. as pointed out in a previous comment, defence spending will be enormously higher within an independent scotland than it is now, despite us actually paying out equally enormously less amounts of money for it than we do at present.   and by the way of course those countries had a choice. one by coercion, yes, but in this day and age, how many political military decisions aren't? and the vast reduction in nuclear arms throughout the world, is most certainly out of choice. global nuclear disarmament is an ongoing and actually quite successful affair. given that scotlands policies on foreign affairs don't require us to facilitate nukes (unlike the uk as a whole), we will be not only stupid and wasteful of resources to keep them, but delighted to give them back to the then ruk where they belong.",0

6815,"there seem to me a number of problems/concerns/questions i am noticing here,  how does it stand up to heat, does it get brittle after heated, what about strength testing, what about other applications besides only styrofoam type plastics (for example, rubbers, various strengths of plastics, etc...), what about coloring it, or clear plastics, what about consistent results in all those categories (rather than having different results depending on a number of factors), how does it deal with moisture in applications such as food that carries moisture, or sprinkler systems, how does it stand up to uv, etc...  yes, it seems good for some type of applications but in order to really do much of anything in the plastics market it has to address these issues.  also, what about health risks with this too?  is it possible for moisture in food packages to contaminate our food and possibly poison us?  how does the body handle long term exposure to the product (certainly not saying plastics are great about this at all but this may carry its own problems so what are they, time and scientific testing will be the key to finding out more about this)?  the surface is visibly rough and inconsistent which is a bad thing when precision is needed in a product, if i need my material within 10,000th of an inch and uniform over the entirety of a surface how can we achieve that with something grown in its own open mold rather than injected into a closed mold with those specific requirements?  just growing it in a mold isn't going to be enough, we need a way to inject it into a mold and rapidly cool it in order to get precise measurements for standards in our applications.  this is also why how it deals with heat and if it gets brittle after being heated will be so important.  i am sure there are some great uses out there for it and i look forward to seeing it in use.  however, i do not think this is ready to handle anything like what plastics do.  i wish the best for the product but i am far from convinced.  this seems to me to cover far less than 1% of plastics applications in its current state as a product.  best of luck.",0

6899,"  because the brains of people with adhd and the brains of people who don't have adhd are litteraly physically different, amphetamine salts affect those two groups very differently. for people with adhd adderall stimulates the brain, compensating for the lack of stimulation present in their brain. it brings chemicals to ""normal"" levels. for those that don't have adhd, don't have this natural imbalance of chemicals, so ultimately the adderall would be unnecessary, or even harmful. many people develop addictions to adderall and it destroys their life. that's not to say everything is great for people with adhd to take adderall; the well known side effects of a lack of appetite and loss of sleep are not ideal. if treated properly, the improvement in the lives of people with adhd usually outweighs these side effects.",0

8260,"  drugs are fun and dangerous at the same time, only people in the right head space should do it. your teachers and parents tell you not to do it because some people take it as an anti depressant and could affect their life even more with addiction. i don't think shrooms are bad, i think it can be a great thing for creative artists to get unstuck with or for people wanting to open their minds a little bit by doing a nature walk. you can have good trips and bad ones, the good ones make you feel so happy, colors are more vibrant, watching comedies is hilarious, when you're done you just appreciate the high cause some people even go through a deep thought that helps them in their overall life and wellbeing. i also believe it's something that you should do maybe once every 3 months, if the high is really good then twice a year. you also shouldn't do it alone. my teachers and parents wanted me to stay away from marijuana, i ended up giving in and now my parents support it. even go as far as asking me what would be good for them. some teachers see it as a gateway drug that will lead you down to meth, fentanyl, heroine, etc. like i said, they're not for everyone and even doctors say that a shroom trip can have medicinal benefits as with marijuana.",0

If that's the case, i wonder if you have sociopathic tendencies. ADHD is a disease with clear research results of delayed development of the cerebral cortex. Even with MRI, the difference in the thickness of the frontal cortex is thinner than normal people. Even on the EEG, the frontal lobe EEG is weak. Addition of the neurotransmitter Ritalin alone results in an ameliorative response. If you look at these three differences from normal people, it is a disease. Where are you cheating? There are three times when you can fix it: under 2 years old, under 10 years old, and under 20 years old. Think of the parents who wouldn't even consider these 3 opportunities with your irresponsible comments. You really are... a bad person. Centers that do business with this kind of business... Instructors are really annihilated. If you really want to make sure you are familiar with adhd, read a paper or take a second look at yourself.",0

8780,"i can actually train myself to ignore people around me on autopilot. i have decided after some real introspective thinking to seek higher education. people won't believe me and i understand that, because of how i've disappointed those around me, but so what? people will be people and they will also be immature. i'm going to move on with my life and forget about the ones who've ghosted me. i don't approve of people spying on each other using big data and neither should you. i've trained myself to disassociate myself from those around me to withstand the mass surveillance of big data that doesn't work on everyone, especially in certain stages of development in their lives. i'm a solitary individual that needs some space and i've made some really dumb decisions because of being spied upon and not being given any personal space.   another example of big data not working is people making erroneous conclusions about some of my actions. around 2:00 pm i meditated on the couch, which resulted in me falling into a sleep state. i assume people who are watching me made the judgment that i was scared about being watched on the outside. it's not, big data is useless without context.     i'm going on a journey of change after being bullied by my local community and i've adopted this technique to cope with this mass amount of bullying. i'm also minimized inside my own family as well. they're a bunch of liars and thieves. there's no point in chatting with those who won't accept compromise or listen to the other side. i've tried being a writer and it didn't pan out. i accept the cost of my decisions and what it entails. i may have a gift, but it's the reason why i use the gift that determines whether or not i use it.   i part with a final message, with all due respect you really don't know me all that well. how many conversations have you guys had with me? zero, i bet. grow up, do some self-reflection on what you guys want to do with your life. i make bad decisions when watched. you have to let go sometimes and let people ""rot"" as they say. if there's one thing i've learned from my experience, it's that friends aren't worth keeping if they're willing to sell you out on a dime. never rely on others for help, because they will always disappoint you if you're not ready for it. who knows, maybe what i've written sounds crazy. idk, here's my truth. let my truth be a warning for those who write good ideas on a computer. always do the base minimum required, because it only gives you more trouble. introverts are being attacked by the nsa for being who they are. they hide from their peers and the community for a reason because they're ignorant about their stages of development. for those who have stellar ideas like my mine, hide from the general public. think about the general state of the world. their mad dogs who created the world the way it is today, their stupid decisions led up to this point. if you suspect you are being watched, immediately stop writing. they will ruin your personal relationships to get what they want. reveal yourself, when you are ready. ignore ignorance, because ignorant people respond with more ignorance, which causes you to make ignorant decisions. you don't want that.",0
